# API's in Redux

## Objective
Create a single page app that sources from 2 API's. The Last Airbender view of the page will pull random characters and display cards in a grid with an image and the name of each character. The Simpsons view of the page will display a random quote from the Simpsons series along with the image of the character to whom the quote is attributed. A button will load a new quote on to the page.

Both views will utilize Material UI for styling. I plan to experiment with responsive containers, grids with breakpoints (mobile vs desktop), and Card components.
